### Example Ansible playbooks ###

Here are some example playbooks for using the [Insights for RHEL Planning API] to get RHEL lifecycle data. They make the process of getting an access token and using that to interact with Red Hat APIs a bit easier.


#### Prerequisites ####

[Ansible Core] 2.16 or later.

Create a [Red Hat account] and an [offline token]. The offline token is used to generate an access token, which expires in 15 minutes.

#### Running the playbooks ####

Once you have an offline token, set the token to the `RH_OFFLINE_TOKEN` environment variable and run the playbook.


```shell
export RH_OFFLINE_TOKEN=[token]
ansible-playook rhel-lifecycle-data.yml
```

By default, the response is only display and not saved. To save the response, set `SAVE_RESPONSE=yes`.
